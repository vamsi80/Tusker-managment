/**
 * Project Access Control System
 * 
 * Role Hierarchy (highest to lowest):
 * 1. PROJECT_MANAGER - Full project access, can manage all aspects including members
 * 2. LEAD - Limited execution authority, can manage tasks but NOT members
 * 3. MEMBER - Can create and manage own tasks
 * 4. VIEWER - Read-only access
 * 
 * CRITICAL RULES:
 * - Workspace roles (OWNER/ADMIN/MANAGER) do NOT automatically grant project access
 * - OWNER/ADMIN can see all projects but must be explicitly added as PROJECT_MANAGER to manage
 * - Workspace MANAGER can only see projects they created or are added to
 * - LEAD cannot manage project members (only PROJECT_MANAGER can)
